## Requirements

Before building the SFFileManagementKit project, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

- **CMake**: Version 3.15.1 or higher
- **Xcode**: Version compatible with AppleClang and Swift 6.0 (for macOS users)
- **Swift**: Version 6.0 or higher
- **AppleClang**: Version 16.0 or higher
- **Command Line Tools**: Xcode 16 Command Line Tools installed

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager (swift) (recommended)

You can integrate SFFileManagementKit into your project using Swift Package Manager (SPM). Here‚Äôs how:

1. In Xcode 16, open your project and navigate to File ‚Üí Swift Packages ‚Üí Add Package Dependency...
2. Paste the repository URL (https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/SFFileManagementKit.git) and click Next.
3. For Version, verify it's Up to next major.
4. Click Next and select the `SFFileManagementKit` package.
5. Click Finish.

You can also add it to the dependencies of your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/SFFileManagementKit.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```

### Build Instructions

To build the project, use the provided `build.sh` script. This script will create a build directory, configure the project with CMake using the ninja, and then build the project using ninja.

```sh
cd scripts
chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Create a `build` directory in the project root if it does not exist.
- Configure the project with CMake using the ninja.
- Build the project using `ninja`.
- Lint the entire project using `clang-tidy`

#### Clean Up

To clean up the build artifacts and CMake-generated files, use the `clean_build.sh` script:

```sh
chmod u+x clean_build.sh
./clean_build.sh
```

This script will remove the `build` directory and CMake cache files.
